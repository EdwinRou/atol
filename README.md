# atol: python3 package for _ATOL: Automatic Topologically-Oriented Learning_

**Author**: Martin Royer

# Description

atol is a python package implementing an automatic featurisation procedure for TDA that enhances learning problems. It is based on the ATOL paper https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02296513. It contains a notebook with short usage demonstration 'atol-demo.ipynb'. Install with:

	$ git clone https://github.com/martinroyer/atol
	$ cd atol
	$ (sudo) pip install .

# Dependencies

We use the data folder and functions from the 'perslay' repository: https://github.com/MathieuCarriere/perslay, so this package should be installed at the same level as atol for instance.
